  * `git checkout -b [INSERT_BRANCH_NAME_HERE]`
* List files that have changes.
  * `git status`
* Add changes files to be staged for commit.
  * `git add .`
* Commit changes with commit message
  * `git commit -m "[INSERT_COMMIT_MESSAGE_HERE]"`
* Will allow for more detailed multiline commits but I would focus on üëÜüèΩ
  * `git commit`
* Push local changes to remote branch.
  * `git push`

### Advanced:
* Save (or stash) changed files without committing them.
  * ` git stash`
